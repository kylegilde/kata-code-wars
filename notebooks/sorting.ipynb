    "Bubble sort can be visualized as a queue where people arrange themselves by swapping with each other so that they all can stand in ascending order of their heights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or in other words, we compare two adjacent elements and see if their order is wrong, if the order is wrong we swap them. (i.e arr[i] > arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= s; where s is the size of the array, if array is to be in ascending order, and vice-versa).\n",
